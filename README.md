# Manual-to-Motorized-Linear-Translation-Stage-Upgrade-Kit, using the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a heat shrink flexure.
A design for upgrading a manual linear translation stage to an automatic one, whilst retaining the  original precision of the device.

>>>The files for the design are available here but the project tutorial is currently a work in Progress.

## Intro

## BILL OF MATERIALS
  ```
  Raspberry Pi Pico W
  28BYJ-48 stepper motor, 1/16th reduction (or equivalent)
  A suitable stepper motor driver board (this guide references the driver board in this pack: https://thepihut.com/products/stepper-motor-driver-pack)
  A suitable plastic project box (metal cannot be used as it will block wifi connectivity)
  USB A to Micro USB 2.0 cable
  20 mm diameter heat shrink
  ```
