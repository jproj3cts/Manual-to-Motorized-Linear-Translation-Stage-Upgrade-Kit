# Manual-to-Motorized-Linear-Translation-Stage-Upgrade-Kit, using the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and a heat shrink flexure.
The cheapest possible design for upgrading a manual linear translation stage to an automatic one, whilst retaining the original precision of the device. 

>>>The files for the design are available here but the project tutorial is currently a work in Progress.

## Intro

This guide 

It can also serve as a tutorial on how to remotely control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor over wifi, via a website hosted on a Pi Pico W. This is likely a more general appliction of this project. If this is what you would like to do, then simply skip the Connecting Flexure section of this guide.

## BILL OF MATERIALS
  ```
  Raspberry Pi Pico W
  28BYJ-48 stepper motor, 1/16th reduction (or equivalent)
  A suitable stepper motor driver board (this guide references the driver board in this pack: https://thepihut.com/products/stepper-motor-driver-pack)
  A suitable plastic project box (metal cannot be used as it will block wifi connectivity)
  USB A to Micro USB 2.0 cable
  20 mm diameter heat shrink
  ```
